# About `Tickets`

## Business goal

Tickets system is a cutting-edge Concert tickets selling platform with a revolutionary pricing algorithm and super friendly for Concert organizers (called Vendors) to sell their concerts with a remarkable profit.

## Purpose

The system is built as a training example for [Testing Microservices](https://bottega.com.pl/szkolenie-ms-testing).

## Architecture

The overall System consists of many microservices. This repository holds a subset of them, essential for Vendors to create concerts. High level architecture is below.

# Importing to IDE

You should import the `Tickets/build.gradle` as a root project to your IDE.

## Verify after import

Execute tests to check if the system is working on your machine and tests are green.

I suggest running IntelliJ task `Tickets test --all` to run all kinds of tests in the system. Alternatively you can run `./gradlew test` for all the services. Follow this doc to find out details.

Reach me out in case of any difficulties.

# Running

Both Gradle and IntelliJ run configurations are available.

Those are fine-grained configurations starting apps and executing tests on a desired level (Micro, Unit, Component,
Dependency, Api, Contract, GUI, System)

## Starting off the whole Tickets system

Tickets System consists of several services you need to run to see it working. See running instructions below:

| Service    | IntelliJ Idea task | Manual command                                                          |
|------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Kafka      | `kafka run`        | run `docker-compose.yml` using `docker compose up` under `infra/kafka/` |
| Vendor GUI | `vendor-ui run`    | `ng serve` from `vendor-ui/`                                            |
| Vendor     | `Vendor run`       | `./gradlew bootRun` from `Vendor/`                                      |
| Pricing    | `Pricing run`      | `./gradlew bootRun` from `Pricing/`                                     |

## Opening the GUI

Open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser and enjoy!

# Run and test configurations

## Gradle

Execute gradle tasks by executing `./gradlew <task-name>`, where task names are defined
in `services/<service>/gradle/test-suites.gradle`. To run all tests at once use task `test`

Tasks available for Tests are as follows

### Running `Vendor`, `Pricing` and `SharedLib`

- `bootRun`: starts the service
- `microTest`: runs suites suffixed with `MicroTest` and `MicroSpec`
- `unitTest`: runs suites suffixed with `UnitTest` and `UnitSpec`
- `compTest`: runs suites suffixed with `CompTest` and `CompSpec`
- `depTest`: runs suites suffixed with `DepTest` and `DepSpec`
- `apiTest`: runs suites suffixed with `CompTest` and `CompSpec`
- `contractTest`: runs contract tests defined in `/src/contractTests/resources/contracts`

Note: `SharedLib` as an utils library contains only `microTest`,

#### Prerequisites

Installed:

- gradle
- JDK 17+
- IDE (recommended: IntelliJ Idea)
- git
- docker
- docker compose

Operating System: Ubuntu (recommended). `Tickets` is also ready to run on Windows, however docker on Windows is unpredictable.

### Running `vendor-ui`

As an Angular project the task config is different here.

- `ng serve`: runs app on under `localhost:4200`
- `protractor conf.js` executes isolated GUI tests on `vendor-ui`. Note: execute from `services/vendor-ui/src/e2e`

#### Prerequisites

Installed:

- node.js `sudo apt install nodejs`
- Angular `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- Protractor `npm install -g protractor`
- Chrome Browser

Before start, install node dependencies by running `npm install` from `services/vendor-ui`

### Running `TicketsTests`

The project holds System Tests only, all under `src/test` with gradle task:

- `test`: runs tests against the Tickets System

## Run configs in IntelliJ Idea

All the configurations listed above are also exported to this repo as an IntelliJ Idea configurations. They reside
in `.run` directory and should be automatically imported once `Tickets` project is imported.

Some run configurations are using [Multirun plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7248-multirun) to start all microservices in the system. Consider installing the plugin: 

# Tests

## `Pricing` and `Vendor` Microservices

- All internal tests are under `src/test/java`
- Contracts are under `src/contractTest/resources`
- Generated contract tests are in `build/generated-test-sources/contractTest`

## `vendor-ui`

Protractor tests are located under `src/e2e/test`

## `SharedLib` and `TicketsTests`

- All tests are under `src/test/java`

# Vendor API Stubs

To start Vendor Stub, based on Contract tests, see [README](services/Vendor/api-stubs/README.MD)

# Project Structure

Important paths in project are:

```

└── libs/SharedLib                              // Java library embedded in services
└── services                                    // Microservices building up Tickets system
│   └── Pricing
│   └── Vendor
|       └── api-stubs/run-contract-stubs.sh     // execute to run Vendor API Stubs based on Contract Tests to test vendor-ui
│   └── vendor-ui
└── SystemTests/TicketsTests                    // separate project holding E2E System Tests for Tickets
```
